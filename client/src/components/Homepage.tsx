          If you are playing 1v1 gem hunt, navigate to the 1v1 ladder, login, and
          click Report Match Results. Your opponent will be notified and must
          confirm the result of the matches. You can look for opponents in the
          MIU Discord, and then host private matches to play your games. PC, Xbox, Switch, and PS5 all currently have cross-platform support in MIU.

          If you are posting a solo gem hunt run, click 'Report Result' and fill
          out the form. With the goal of these leaderboards being as credible as
          possible, gem hunt submissions *must* include a screenshot or
          recording of the score and are subject to approval. There is currently
          no way to automatically parse multiplayer scores.
